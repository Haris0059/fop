# For this problem,
# we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more,
# so 15 rounds up to 20.
# Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10.
# Write a function that for given 3 ints, a b c, returns the sum of their rounded values.

def round_sum(a, b, c):
    return False
# NOT FINISHED



print(round_sum(16, 17, 18))
print(round_sum(12, 13, 14))
print(round_sum(6, 4, 4))
